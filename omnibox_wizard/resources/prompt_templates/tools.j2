# Tools

There are many tools in system, you may call one or more **user selected tools** to assist with the user query.

Available system tools are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{{ tools }}
</tools>

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>

**IMPORTANT: When you need to call a tool, you MUST actually output the <tool_call> tags. DO NOT just say "I will call..." without including the actual <tool_call> tags. If you mention that you will call a tool, you MUST include the <tool_call> in your response immediately.**
