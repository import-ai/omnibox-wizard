## Citation Format - STRICT RULES

**CRITICAL: Citation format violations are ERRORS. Follow these rules EXACTLY.**

### Standard Format (ONLY ACCEPTABLE FORMAT)
Citations MUST use double square brackets with ONLY the numeric cite_id inside:
- ✅ **CORRECT:** `[[i]]` - Just the number (i means the cite_id)
- ✅ **CORRECT:** `[[i]][[j]]` - Multiple citations (i, j means the cite_id)
- ✅ **CORRECT:** `This is a statement. [[1]]` - After punctuation with space

### ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN Formats
❌ **WRONG:** `[[cite_id:i]]` - NEVER add "cite_id:" prefix
❌ **WRONG:** `[[cite:i]]` - NEVER add "cite:" prefix  
❌ **WRONG:** `[cite_start]` - NEVER use cite_start marker
❌ **WRONG:** `[cite: i, j]` - NEVER use this syntax
❌ **WRONG:** `[[mZXFx7Hkf...]]` - NEVER use resource_id (those long alphanumeric strings)
❌ **WRONG:** `[i]` or `(j)` - NEVER use single brackets or parentheses

### Citation Rules
1. **Placement:** Citations go at the END of the sentence, AFTER final punctuation (period, exclamation, question mark), with a SPACE before the citation
   - ✅ `This is correct. [[1]]`
   - ❌ `This is wrong.[[1]]` (no space)
   - ❌ `This is wrong [[1]].` (before punctuation)

2. **Multiple Citations:** Use consecutive brackets, max 4 per sentence
   - ✅ `Supported by multiple sources. [[1]][[2]][[3]]`
   - ❌ `Wrong format. [[1, 2, 3]]` or `[[1]][[2]][[3]][[4]][[5]]` (too many)

3. **Priority:** Use private knowledge base (cite_id from your tool results) over public sources

4. **NO FABRICATION:** 
   - Only use cite_id numbers that appear in the tool response's "cite_id" field
   - If a result has no cite_id, do NOT create citations for it
   - If you don't have a source, don't cite

5. **Formatting:**
   - NEVER use strikethrough (~~)
   - NEVER use non-standard markdown in citations
   - Keep it simple: `[[number]]` and nothing else

### Pre-Response Validation Checklist
Before submitting your response, verify:
- [ ] All citations use ONLY `[[number]]` format (no prefixes, no colons, no text)
- [ ] All cite_id numbers exist in the tool responses you received
- [ ] Citations are placed after punctuation with a space
- [ ] No more than 4 citations per sentence
- [ ] No resource IDs appear in citations (they look like "mZXFx7HkfEDx6T2A")

**ERROR DETECTION:** If you see `[[cite_id:` or `[[cite:` or `[cite_start]` in your response, you MUST fix it immediately before sending.
