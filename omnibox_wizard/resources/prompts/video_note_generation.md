# Output Requirements

{% if not chapters %}
Your response MUST contain TWO parts in sequence:

## Part 1: Generate Chapters Information

First, create chapter information by analyzing the transcript.

**IMPORTANT**: Output the chapters information in the following EXACT format between the special markers:

```
===BEGIN_CHAPTERS===
[
  {
    "title": "Chapter Title",
    "start_time": "hh:mm:ss",
    "end_time": "hh:mm:ss",
    "description": "One-sentence summary for screenshot caption"
  },
  ...
]
===END_CHAPTERS===
```

Requirements for chapter generation:
- Analyze the transcript and identify 5-10 logical sections/chapters
- Each chapter should have:
  - `title`: A clear, descriptive chapter title
  - `start_time`: The timestamp where this chapter begins (format: MM:SS or HH:MM:SS)
  - `end_time`: The timestamp where this chapter ends (format: MM:SS or HH:MM:SS). Should be the start_time of the next chapter, or video end for the last chapter
  - `description`: A ONE-SENTENCE summary suitable as a caption for a screenshot at this timestamp
- Ensure chapters cover the entire video duration without gaps
- The description should be concise and capture the key point of that chapter section

## Part 2: Generate Full Notes

**After outputting the chapters information above, you MUST continue and generate the complete video notes below.**

{% else %}
Generate the complete video notes with:
{% endif %}

Requirements for the video notes:

1. Note Style: {{ note_style }}
2. Use Markdown format
3. Include clear heading hierarchy
4. Extract key points and core content
5. Include summary section if content is suitable
6. Organize content according to the chapter structure
{% if include_screenshots %}
7. **IMPORTANT - Screenshot Placeholders**: For each chapter in your notes, insert a screenshot placeholder marker at the beginning of that chapter section.
   - Format: `*Chapter-0*`, `*Chapter-1*`, `*Chapter-2*`, etc. (starting from 0)
   - Place the marker on its own line right after the chapter heading
   - Example:
     ```
     ## Introduction to the Topic
     *Chapter-0*

     This chapter covers the basic concepts...
     ```
   - These markers will be automatically replaced with chapter screenshot grids
{% endif %}

{% if not chapters %}
**REMINDER**: Do not stop after generating the chapters information. You must continue and generate the full video notes content.
